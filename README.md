# Joshua-Miguel-Bernardino-Portfolio
A series of data science projects that utilizes various data analysis and machine learning processes

# [Exploratory Data Analysis on a Supermarket Dataset](https://github.com/Miggy070498/EDA_Supermarket)
- Cleaned incomplete and repetitive data in the dataset
- Performed univariate and bivariate analysis using graphs such as boxplots, scatterplot, and countplots
- Established correlations among different features in the dataset

# [Twitter Sentiment Analysis via Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Miggy070498/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis)
- Cleaned repititive data in the dataset
- Visualized the dataset using bar charts, histograms, and a word cloud
- Created pipeline that removed punctuation, stopwords and vectorizes the dataset
- Trained a Naive Bayes model to predict whether a tweet was postive or negative 
- Assessed the accuracy of the model using a confusion matrix

# [Amazon Review Classification](https://github.com/Miggy070498/Amazon-Reviews)
- Trained various classification algorithms such as linear support vector 
  machines, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree
- Assessed the performance of each through vrious metrics such as mean accuracy
  and F1 score

# [Grade Predictor](https://github.com/Miggy070498/Grade-Prediction)
- Cleaned and optimized dataset by removing outliers
- Graphed multiple features to assess correlation with target variable
- Trained a linear regression model and performed feature selection
- Assessed model via mean score (0.9372848577938546)

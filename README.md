# [Exploratory Data Analysis on a Supermarket Dataset](https://github.com/Miggy070498/EDA_Supermarket)
A series of analyses done on a supermarket dataset to establish correlations among features

[Code](https://github.com/Miggy070498/EDA_Supermarket/blob/main/Supermarket%20EDA.ipynb)            [Dataset](https://github.com/Miggy070498/EDA_Supermarket/blob/main/supermarket_sales.csv)  
- Cleaned incomplete and repetitive data in the dataset
- Performed univariate and bivariate analysis using graphs such as boxplots, scatterplot, and countplots
- Established correlations among different features in the dataset

# [Twitter Sentiment Analysis via Naive Bayes](https://github.com/Miggy070498/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis)
Naive Bayes model that classifies a certain tweet as positive or negative

[Code](https://github.com/Miggy070498/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/Tweet%20Sentiment%20Analysis.ipynb)            [Dataset](https://github.com/Miggy070498/Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis/blob/main/twitter.csv)
- Cleaned repititive data in the dataset
- Visualized the dataset using bar charts, histograms, and a word cloud
- Created pipeline that removed punctuation, stopwords and vectorizes the dataset
- Trained a Naive Bayes model to predict whether a tweet was postive or negative 
- Assessed the accuracy of the model using a confusion matrix
